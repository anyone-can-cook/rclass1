# Course description

This course has two foundational goals: (1) to develop core skills in "data management," which are important regardless of which programming language you use, and (2) to learn the fundamentals of the R programming language.

Data management consists of acquiring, investigating, cleaning, combining, and manipulating data. Most statistics courses teach you how to analyze data that are ready for analysis. In real research projects, cleaning the data and creating analysis datasets is often more time consuming than conducting analyses.  This course teaches the fundamental data management and data manipulation skills necessary for creating analysis datasets.

The course will be taught in R, a free, open-source programming language. R has become the most popular language for statistical analysis, surpassing SPSS, Stata, and SAS. What differentiates R from these other languages is the thousands of open-source "libraries" created by R users. R is one of the most popular languages for "data science," because R libraries have been created for web-scraping, mapping, network analysis, etc.  By learning R you can be confident that you know a programming language that can run any modeling technique you might need and has amazing capabilities for data collection and data visualization. By learning fundamentals of R in this course, you will be "one step away" from web-scraping, network analysis, interactive maps, quantitative text analysis, or whatever other data science application you are interested in.

## Prerequisite Requirements 

- Students must have taken at least a one-semester introductory statistics course
- Students should have some very basic experience using statistical programming software (e.g., SPSS, Stata, R, SAS) 
- [General computer skills] Students should be able to download files from the internet, rename these files, save them to a folder of your choosing, and open this folder
    - During this course we will often be downloading datasets, opening .Rmd files and .R scripts, changing directories to the folder where we stored the data, and then opening the dataset we just downloaded

## Course structure

For the first two weeks of the course, we will have synchronous lectures and classtime will be from 8:30am to 11:20am on Fridays. In the subsequent weeks, we will have asynchronous (pre-class) lectures and meet just from 10am to 11:20am for a synchronous workshop-style class. Weekly homework will consist of students working through the lectures on their own and a modest amount of required reading.

1. __Asynchronous (pre-class) lectures__. Weekly asynchronous lectures will be posted on the course website with the expectation that students work through the lecture in advance of our weekly synchronous class meeting. Lecture materials will consist of three types of resources: first, detailed lecture slides (PDF or HTML) with sample code; second, short videos (e.g., 15 to 30 total minutes per week) that provide a high-level discussion of important and/or challenging concepts from the lecture slides, but not a line-by-line recitation of the lecture; and, third, the .Rmd file that created the PDF/HTML lecture slides. This .Rmd file will contain all "code chunks" and links to all data utilized in the lecture. Thus, students will be able to "learn by doing" in that they can run R code on their own computer while they work through lecture materials on their own.
1. __Synchronous workshop-style class meetings.__ We will have one synchronous class meeting per week. Typically, these meetings will begin with a discussion of concepts students found difficult or confusing from the lecture materials. The majority of class time will be devoted to students working in groups on a substantive activity posed by the instructor. While students work in groups, the instructor and TA will visit each group to answer questions and talk through ideas. We will not be recording these synchronous sessions to respect student privacy.

# Classroom environment

We all have a responsibility to ensure that every member of the class feels valued and safe. 
Be mindful that our words and body language affects others in ways we might not fully understand. We have a responsibility to express our ideas in a way that doesn't make disparaging generalizations and doesn't make people feel excluded. As an instructor, I am responsible for setting an example through my own conduct.

Learning regression, while trying to get a handle on R and unfamiliar data can feel overwhelming! We must create an environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and talking about what they did not understand. Discomfort is part of the learning process. Unburdern yourself from the weight of being an "expert." Focus your energy on improving and helping your classmates improve.

##  Towards an anti-racist learning experience

Every course should be an anti-racist course, even when the subject matter is broadly oriented. In this course we'll engage with research that reflect systemic gaps based on race, ethnicity, immigration status, and gender identity, among other aspects of identity. We will discuss whether the language, the framing, the analyses, and even the research question of a study contribute to problematic beliefs. If so, how can we do better? It is also critical that we acknowledge that the social and economic marginalization reflected in data is rooted in systemic oppression that upholds opportunity for some at the expense of others. We should all be thinking about our own role in upholding these systems.

# Course website and communication

## Course website

All course related material can be found on the [course website](https://anyone-can-cook.github.io/rclass1). Pre-recorded lecture videos, lecture slides (PDF/HTML), and .Rmd files will be posted on the class website under the associated sections. Additional resources (e.g., syllabus) may also be posted on the class website. 

## Course discussion

We will be using GitHub teams for class announcements [HERE](https://github.com/orgs/anyone-can-cook/teams/rclass1_announcements).

  - __GitHub teams__: The teaching team will post all class announcements using GitHub teams. The GitHub team discussions feature allows for quick and seamless communication to all members of an organization or team -- in this case, to all students with a GitHub account enrolled in the course. Some features include:  
  
    1. The class team can be viewed and [`@mentioned`](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams) by all students enrolled in the class and part of the organization.  
    2. Posts can include code snippets, links, images, and references to issues which make them ideal for this class discussion and participation.

*Credit: [Introducing team discussions](https://github.blog/2017-11-20-introducing-team-discussions/)*  

We will be using GitHub issues for questions and class discussion [HERE](https://github.com/anyone-can-cook/rclass1_student_issues).

  - __GitHub issues__: GitHub issues are traditionally used by collaborators of a repository for managing tasks for a project. Our rational for using issues is twofold: 1) help track and organize questions related to course material and problem sets and 2) promote classroom participation. Students are encouraged to contribute to issues by posting questions, sharing helpful resources, and/or taking a stab at answering questions posted on issues. Some features include: 
    
    1. Adding labels  
    2. Assigning or mentioning users to an issue 
    3. Referencing other issues

# Assignments and grading

Course grade will be based on the following components:

-	Weekly problem sets (90 percent of total grade)
-	Attendance and participation (10 percent of total grade)

## Problem sets (90 percent of total grade)

Students will complete 10 problem sets (the last one due during finals week). Problem sets are due by 10am each Friday, right before we start class. 

Late submissions will lose 20% (i.e., max grade becomes 80%). Problem sets not submitted by 12pm the following Monday will not receive points because at that point we will post solutions on the course website. The lowest problem-set grade will be dropped from the calculation of your final grade. 

Your will not lose points for late submission if you cannot submit a problem set due to an unexpected emergency. But please contact the instructor by email as soon as you can so we can work out a plan.

In general, each problem set will give you practice using the skills and concepts introduced during the previous lecture.  For example, after the lecture on joining (merging) datasets, the problem set for that week will require that students complete several different tasks involving merging data.  Additionally, the weekly problem sets will require you to use data manipulation skills you learned in previous weeks.  

With the exception of the first problem set, students will complete problem sets in groups of 3. We will form groups during class in week 2 and you will keep the same group throughout the quarter. However, each student will submit their own assignment. You are encouraged to work together and get help from your group. However, it is important that you understand how to do the problem set on your own, rather than copying the solution developed by group members.  

Since you will be working together, it is understandable that answers for many questions will be the same as your group members. However, if I find compelling evidence that a student merely copied solutions from a classmate, I will consider this a violation of academic integrity and that student will receive a zero for the homework assignment.

A general strategy I recommend for completing the problem sets is as follows: (1) after lecture, do the reading associated with that lecture; (2) try doing the problem set on your own; (3) communicate with your group to work through the problem set, with a particular focus on areas group members find challenging.

Link to problem set expectations and helpful resources [HERE](https://github.com/ozanj/rclass/raw/master/lectures/problemset_resources.pdf).

## Attendance and participation (10 percent of total grade)

Students are expected to participate in the weekly class meetings by being attentive, supportive, by asking questions, or by answering questions posed by others on Zoom. Additionally, students can receive strong participation grades by asking questions and answering questions on GitHub issues. 

Students are required to attend the weekly class meetings. Each unexcused absence results in a loss of 20% from your attendance/participation grade. Three or more unexcused absences will result in a failing grade for the course. 

An excused absence is a professional opportunity that you discuss with me beforehand or a medical, or family emergency.  Excused absences will not result in a loss of attendance points.  However, you will be responsible for all material covered in that class and you will be expected to turn in homework assignments on time.

## Grading scale

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)

lg <- c("A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D", "F")
nv <- c("99-100%", "93<99%", "90<93%", "87<90%", "83<87%", "80<83%", "77<80%", "73<77%", "70<73%", "60<70%", "0<60%")

grade <- tibble(lg, nv)

kable(grade,col.names = c("Letter Grade", "Percentage"), escape = T) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left")
```

# Course policies

## Learning during a global pandemic

With the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, we understand that right now is a challenging time for everybody. Many of us may be experiencing added stress or responsibilties that make learning and completing classwork difficult. If you are having trouble keeping up with the class, please reach out to the teaching team and we will help work out a plan with you. We want to be accomodating to everyone's unique situation and hope to make this class an enjoyable learning experience for all.

## Online collaboration/netiquette

You will communicate with instructors and peers virtually through a variety of tools such as GitHub, email, and Zoom web conferencing. The following guidelines will enable everyone in the course to participate and collaborate in a productive, safe environment.

-	Be professional, courteous, and respectful as you would in a physical classroom.
-	Online communication lacks the nonverbal cues that provide much of the meaning and nuances in face-to-face conversations. Choose your words carefully, phrase your sentences clearly, and stay on topic.
-	It is expected that students may disagree with the research presented or the opinions of their fellow classmates. To disagree is fine but to disparage others' views is unacceptable. All comments should be kept civil and thoughtful.
- It is imperative that we respect one another in this course, and all other spaces. One way to gain/show respect is to actively listen to one another. Please do not text, tweet, email, Facebook, LinkedIn, browse the internet, and such during class.
- In the unlikely event that Zoom is down, please be sure to check your email often for instructions on how we will complete that class session in an asynchronous manner.

## Academic accomodations

**Center for Accessible Education**  

Students needing academic accommodations based on a disability should contact the Center for Accessible Education (CAE). When possible, students should contact the CAE within the first two weeks of the term as reasonable notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. For more information visit https://www.cae.ucla.edu/.

Located in A255 Murphy Hall: (310) 825-1501, TDD (310) 206-6083; http://www.cae.ucla.edu/

-	Due to COVID-19, the CAE office is closed for in-person meetings
-	CAE counselor, resources, and services are still available via email / virtual appointment
-	Stay up-to-date with CAE newsletters & announcements at https://www.cae.ucla.edu/announcements-events/student

## Academic integrity

__UCLA policy__  

  - UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all members including faculty, staff and students alike are responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member of the University community, you are here to get an education and are, therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work, multiple submissions without the permission of the professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary proceedings.  
  
__This class__  

  - Given that 90% of course grade is based on problem sets, the primary academic honesty concern that could come up in this class is copying problem set solutions from somebody else and passing this in as your own work.


# Course schedule
