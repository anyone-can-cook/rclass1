# Operator Precedence and Associativity  

It is important to understand operator precedence and associativity when working with data in general, but particularly when we use logical operators like `&` or `|` to filter data.  

<br>  

**Operator Precedence**  

Operator Precedence refers to the order in which operators are executed. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first and operators with the lowest precedence are evaluated last. If you recall [PEMDAS](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-pemdas-definition-rule-examples.html#:~:text=PEMDAS%20is%20an%20acronym%20for,until%20the%20calculation%20is%20complete.), multiplication `*` takes precedence over addition `+`.   


```r
1 + 2 * 6
```

```
## [1] 13
```

If we add a parenthesis to the equation, our answer changes.  

```r
(1 + 2) * 6
```

```
## [1] 18
```

<br>   

**Operator Associativity**  

When you are working with operators with the same precedence, the execution of the operators is determined through associativity.   

> Operators with same precedence follows operator associativity defined for its operator group. In R, operators can either follow left-associative, right-associative or have no associativity. Operators with left-associative are evaluted from left to right, operators with right-associative are evaluated from right to left and operators with no associativity, does not follow any predefined order.

**R logical operator precedence**  

According to this [link](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Syntax.html), the `&` takes precedence over `|`. And both logical operators are left-associative, meaning they are evaluated from left to right.

**Now let's see an example using the data frame from problem set 3**   


Why do we get different results?

```r
nrow(subset(df_event, event_state %in% c("CA", "FL", "MA") & event_type == "public hs" | total_students_pri > 1000))
```

```
## [1] 2911
```

```r
nrow(subset(df_event, event_state %in% c("CA", "FL", "MA") & (event_type == "public hs" | total_students_pri > 1000)))
```

```
## [1] 2151
```


Let's try to put our code into words.   

The first code reads. Return observations where the recruiting visit took place at a public high school in the state of California, Florida, or Massachusetts **OR** a private high school where the total number of students is greater than 1000. 


```r
tail(subset(df_event, event_state %in% c("CA", "FL", "MA") & event_type == "public hs" | total_students_pri > 1000, select = c(event_state, event_type, total_students_pri)))
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   event_state event_type total_students_pri
##   <chr>       <chr>                   <dbl>
## 1 HI          private hs               1383
## 2 HI          private hs               1880
## 3 OR          private hs               1300
## 4 OR          private hs               1300
## 5 OR          private hs               1300
## 6 WA          private hs               1132
```

The second code reads. Return observations where the recruiting visit took place at a public high school **OR** private high school where the total number of students is greater than 1000 in the state of California, Florida, or Massachusetts.


```r
tail(subset(df_event, event_state %in% c("CA", "FL", "MA") & (event_type == "public hs" | total_students_pri > 1000), select = c(event_state, event_type, total_students_pri)))
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   event_state event_type total_students_pri
##   <chr>       <chr>                   <dbl>
## 1 CA          public hs                  NA
## 2 CA          public hs                  NA
## 3 CA          public hs                  NA
## 4 CA          public hs                  NA
## 5 CA          public hs                  NA
## 6 CA          public hs                  NA
```


# Practice with pipes    

**wwlist** data frame  

- De-identified list of prospective students purchased by Western Washington University from College Board
- We collected these data using public records requests request


```r

## [40] "pop_latinx_state"       "med_inc_state"
```

```r
#glimpse(wwlist)
#str(wwlist)
```

Let's use `select()`, `filter()`, and `arrange()` to do the following using the Base R approach:  

- Sort `wwlist` descending by `total_students`  
- Select the following variables: `hs_state`,  `hs_city`, `hs_name`, `school_type`, `total_students`  
- Filter for private schools `(school_type == "private")`  
- Print the first 10 observations

```r
head(select(arrange(filter(wwlist, school_type == "private"), desc(total_students)), hs_state, hs_city, hs_name, school_type, total_students), n = 10)
```

```

```r
df_temp <- filter(wwlist,school_type == "private")
df_temp2 <- arrange(df_temp,desc(total_students))
head(select(df_temp2, hs_state, hs_city, hs_name, school_type, total_students),n=10)
```

```

```

```r
rm(df_temp,df_temp2)
```

Now let's use pipes `%` 

```r
wwlist %>%
  filter(school_type == "private") %>%
  arrange(desc(total_students)) %>%
  select(state, hs_name, school_type, total_students) %>%
  head(n = 10)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 4
##    state hs_name                      school_type total_students
##    <chr> <chr>                        <chr>                <int>
##  1 SD    James Madison High School    private               4500
##  2 HI    James Madison High School    private               4500
##  3 MT    American School              private               3356
##  4 HI    <NA>                         private               2014
##  5 NC    Charlotte Country Day School private               1603
##  6 NC    Providence Day School        private               1603
##  7 NC    Charlotte Country Day School private               1603

##  9 NC    Providence Day School        private               1603
## 10 NC    Charlotte Country Day School private               1603
```

<br>  

**Your turn**  

Use`select()`, `filter()`, and `arrange()` to do the following using both the Base R & tidyverse approach:

- Sort `wwlist` descending by `med_inc_zip`  
- Select the following variables: `hs_state`,  `hs_city`, `hs_name`, `school_type`, `med_inc_zip`, `ethn_code`, `med_inc_state`  
- Filter for public schools `(school_type == "public")` in the state of New York `hs_state == "NY"`
- Print the first 10 observations

**Base R**


**Tidyverse using pipes**

Now let's use`select()`, `filter()`, and `arrange()` to do the following using both the Base R & tidyverse approach:  

- Sort `wwlist` descending by `med_inc_zip`  
- Select the following variables: `hs_state`,  `hs_city`, `hs_name`, `school_type`, `med_inc_zip`, `ethn_code`, `med_inc_state`  
- Filter for public schools `(school_type == "public")` where the `med_inc_zip` is less than the `med_inc_state`
- Print the first 10 observations
