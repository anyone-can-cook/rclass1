# Introduction
```



### What we will do today

\tableofcontents
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Use this if you want TOC to show level 2 headings
\tableofcontents
#Use this if you don't want TOC to show level 2 headings
\tableofcontents[subsectionstyle=hide/hide/hide]
```


### Libraries we will use today

"Load" the package we will use today (output omitted)
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
If package not yet installed, then must install before you load. Install in "console" rather than .Rmd file

- Generic syntax: `install.packages("package_name")`
- Install "tidyverse": `install.packages("tidyverse")`

Note: when we load package, name of package is not in quotes; but when we install package, name of package is in quotes:

- `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- `library(tidyverse)`


### Load .Rdata data frames we will use today

Data on off-campus recruiting events by public universities

- Data frame object `df_event`
    - One observation per university, recruiting event
- Data frame object `df_school`
    - One observation per high school (visited and non-visited)

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) # remove all objects in current environment

getwd()
#load dataset with one obs per recruiting event
load(url("https://github.com/ozanj/rclass/raw/master/data/recruiting/recruit_event_somevars.RData"))
#load("../../data/recruiting/recruit_event_somevars.Rdata")

#load dataset with one obs per high school
load(url("https://github.com/ozanj/rclass/raw/master/data/recruiting/recruit_school_somevars.RData"))
#load("../../data/recruiting/recruit_school_somevars.Rdata")
```


#  Missing values [finish-up]

### Missing values

Missing values have the value `NA`

- `NA` is a special keyword, not the same as the character string `"NA"`

use `is.na()` function to determine if a value is missing

- `is.na()` returns a logical vector
```{r}
is.na(5)
is.na(NA)
is.na("NA")
typeof(is.na("NA")) # example of a logical vector

nvector <- c(10,5,NA)
is.na(nvector)
typeof(is.na(nvector)) # example of a logical vector

svector <- c("e","f",NA,"NA")
is.na(svector)
```

### Missing values

Missing values have the value `NA`

- `NA` is a special keyword, not the same as the character string `"NA"`

use `is.na()` function to determine if a value is missing

- `is.na()` returns a logical vector
```{r}
is.na(5)
is.na(NA)
is.na("NA")
typeof(is.na("NA")) # example of a logical vector

nvector <- c(10,5,NA)
is.na(nvector)
typeof(is.na(nvector)) # example of a logical vector

svector <- c("e","f",NA,"NA")
is.na(svector)
```

### Missing values are "contagious"

What does "contagious" mean?

- operations involving a missing value will yield a missing value

```{r}
7>5
7>NA
0==NA
2*c(0,1,2,NA)
NA*c(0,1,2,NA)
```
###  Function and missing values, the `table()` function

`table()` function useful for investigating categorical variables
```{r}
table(df_event$g12offered)
```

By default `table()` ignores `NA` values

- `useNA` argument determines whether to include `NA` values
    - "allowed values correspond to never ("no"); only if count is positive ("ifany"); and even for zero counts ("always")"
```{r}
nrow(df_event)
table(df_event$g12offered, useNA="always")
```
Broader point:

- Most functions that create descriptive statistics have options about how to treat missing values
- When investigating data, good practice to _always_ show missing values

Tip: 

- command `str(df_event)` shows which variables have missing values
```{r results="hide", echo=FALSE}
str(df_event)
```





# Tidyverse vs. Base R

### Why learn to "wrangle" data both via tidyverse and Base R?

- __Base R__: "core" R commands for cleaning and manipulating data that are not part of any external package/library
- __Tidyverse__ has become the leading way many people clean and manipulate data in R
  - These packages make data wrangling simpler than "core" base R commands (most times)
  - Tidyverse commands can be more more efficient (less lines of code, consolidate steps)

\medskip
- But you will inevitably run into edge cases where tidyverse commands don't work the way you expect them to and you'll need to use __base R__

  - Ozan first learned R via tidyverse
  - I first learned R via Base R

\medskip
- It's good to have a basic foundation on both approaches and then decide which you prefer for most data tasks!

- this class will primarily use tidyverse approach 
- future data science seminar will provide examples of edge cases where base R is necessary
 

### Tidyverse  vs. base R  functions

tidyverse | base R | operation
-------|-------|-------
`select()` |  `[ ]`+ `c()` __OR__ `subset()` | "extract" variables
`filter()` | `[ ]`+ `$` __OR__ `subset()` | "extract" observations
`arrange()` | `order()` | sorting data




# Investigating data patterns via Tidyverse

### Introduction to the `dplyr` library

`dplyr`, a package within the `tidyverse` suite of packages, provide tools for manipulating data frames

- Wickham describes functions within `dplyr` as a set of "verbs" that fall in the broader categories of __subsetting__, __sorting__, and __transforming__

Today | Upcoming weeks
------------- | -------------
__Subsetting data__ | __Transforming data__
- `select()` variables  | - `mutate()` creates new variables
- `filter()` observations | - `summarize()` calculates across rows
__Sorting data__ | - `group_by()` to calculate across rows within groups
- `arrange()` | 

All `dplyr` verbs (i.e., functions) work as follows

1. first argument is a data frame
1. subsequent arguments describe what to do with variables and observations in data frame
    - refer to variable names without quotes
1. result of the function is a new data frame

## Select variables

### Select variables using `select()` function

Printing observations is key to investigating data, but datasets often have hundreds, thousands of variables

`select()` function selects __columns__ of data (i.e., variables) you specify

- first argument is the name of data frame object
- remaining arguments are variable names, which are separated by commas and without quotes

Without __assignment__ (`<-`), `select()` by itself simply prints selected vars
```{r}
#?select
select(df_event,instnm,event_date,event_type,event_state,med_inc)
```

### Select variables using `select()` function

Recall that all `dplyr` functions (e.g., `select()`) return a new data frame object

- __type__ equals "list"
- __length__ equals number of vars you select

```{r}
typeof(select(df_event,instnm,event_date,event_type,event_state,med_inc))
length(select(df_event,instnm,event_date,event_type,event_state,med_inc))
```
`glimpse()`: tidyverse function for viewing data frames

- a cross between `str()` and simply printing data
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?glimpse
glimpse(df_event)
```

`glimpse()` a `select()` set of variables
```{r}
glimpse(select(df_event,instnm,event_date,event_type,event_state,med_inc))
```

### Select variables using `select()` function

With __assignment__ (`<-`), `select()` creates a new object containing only the variables you specify

```{r}
event_small <- select(df_event,instnm,event_date,event_type,event_state,med_inc)

glimpse(event_small)
```

### Select

`select()` can use "helper functions" `starts_with()`, `contains()`, and `ends_with()` to choose columns 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?select
```

Example:
```{r}
#names(df_event)

select(df_event,instnm,starts_with("event"))
```

<!--

### Exercise

The data frame `df_school` has one observation for each high school and indicators for whether the high school received a recruiting visit.

```{r results="hide"}
names(df_school)
```
1. Use `select()` to familiarize yourself with variables in the data frame
1. Practice using the `contains()` and `ends_with()` helper functions to to choose variables


-->


### Rename variables



`rename()` function renames variables within a data frame object

\medskip Syntax:

- `rename(obj_name, new_name = old_name,...)`
\medskip
```{r results="hide"}
rename(df_event, g12_offered = g12offered, 
       titlei = titlei_status_pub)
names(df_event)
```
Variable names do not change permanently unless we combine rename with assignment
\medskip
```{r results="hide"}
rename_event <- rename(df_event, g12_offered = g12offered, titlei = titlei_status_pub)
names(rename_event)
rm(rename_event)
```

## Filter rows

### The `filter()` function

`filter()` allows you to __select observations__ based on values of variables

- Arguments
    - first argument is name of data frame
    - subsequent arguments are _logical expressions_ to filter the data frame
    - Multiple expressions separated by commas work as __AND__ operators (e.g., condtion 1 `TRUE` AND condition 2 `TRUE`)

- What is the result of a `filter()` command?
    - `filter()` returns a data frame consisting of rows where the condition is `TRUE`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?filter
```

Example from data frame object `df_school`, each obs is a high school

- Show all obs where the high school received 1 visit from UC Berkeley (110635) [output omitted]
```{r results="hide"}
filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1)
```

Note that resulting object is list, consisting of obs where condition `TRUE`
```{r}
nrow(df_school)
nrow(filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1))
```

### Filter, character variables

Use single quotes `''` or double quotes `""` to refer to values of character variables
```{r}
glimpse(select(df_school, school_type,state_code))
```
Identify all private high schools in CA that got 1 visit by particular universities

- UC-Berkeley (ID=110635)
```{r results="hide"}
filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1, school_type == "private", 
       state_code == "CA")
```

- University of Alabama (ID=100751)
```{r results="hide"}
filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 == 1, school_type == "private", 
       state_code == "CA") 
```

- Visited once by Berkeley and University of Alabama
```{r results="hide"}
filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 == 1, visits_by_110635 == 1, 
       school_type == "private", state_code == "CA") 
```

### Logical operators for comparisons

Symbol | Meaning
-------|-------
`==` | Equal to
`!=` | Not equal to
`>` | greater than
`>=` | greater than or equal to
`<` | less than
`<=` | less than or equal to
`&` | AND 
`|` | OR
`%in` | includes

\medskip 

!["Boolean" operations, x=left circle, y=right circle, from Wichkam (2018)](transform-logical.png){width=50%}

### Filters and comparisons, Demonstration

Schools visited by Bama (100751) and/or Berkeley (110635)

```{r results="hide"}
#berkeley and bama
filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1, visits_by_110635 >= 1) 
filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1 & visits_by_110635 >= 1) # same same
#berkeley or bama
filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1 | visits_by_110635 >= 1) 
```
Apply `count()` function on top of `filter()` function to count the number of observations that satisfy criteria

- Avoids printing individual observations
```{r}
#Number of schools that git visit by Berkeley AND Bama
count(filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1 & visits_by_110635 >= 1))
#Number of schools that git visit by Berkeley OR Bama
count(filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1 | visits_by_110635 >= 1))
```

### Filters and comparisons, >=

\medskip Number of public high schools that are at least 50% Black in Alabama compared to number of schools that received visit by Bama
```{r}
#at least 50% black
count(filter(df_school, school_type == "public", pct_black >= 50, 
             state_code == "AL"))
count(filter(df_school, school_type == "public", pct_black >= 50, 
             state_code == "AL", visits_by_100751 >= 1))
#at least 50% white
count(filter(df_school, school_type == "public", pct_white >= 50, 
             state_code == "AL"))
count(filter(df_school, school_type == "public", pct_white >= 50, 
             state_code == "AL", visits_by_100751 >= 1))
```
### Filters and comparisons, not equals (`!=`)

Count the number of high schools visited by University of Colorado (126614) that are not located in CO
```{r}

#number of high schools visited by U Colorado
count(filter(df_school, visits_by_126614 >= 1))

#number of high schools visited by U Colorado not located in CO
count(filter(df_school, visits_by_126614 >= 1, state_code != "CO"))
#number of high schools visited by U Colorado located in CO
#count(filter(df_school, visits_by_126614 >= 1, state_code == "CO"))
```
### Filters and comparisons, %in% operator

What if you wanted to count the number of schools visited by Bama (100751) in a group of states?
```{r}
count(filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1, state_code == "MA" |
               state_code == "VT" | state_code == "ME"))
```
Easier way to do this is with `%in%` operator
```{r}
count(filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1, state_code %in% c("MA","ME","VT")))
```

Select the private high schools that got either 2 or 3 visits from Bama
```{r}
count(filter(df_school, visits_by_100751 %in% 2:3, school_type == "private"))
```
### Identifying data type and possible values helpful for filtering

- `class()` and `str()` shows data type of a variable 
- `table()` to show potential values of categorical variables

```{r}
class(df_event$event_type)
str(df_event$event_type)
table(df_event$event_type, useNA="always")
class(df_event$event_state)
str(df_event$event_state) # double quotes indicate character
class(df_event$med_inc)
str(df_event$med_inc)
```

Now that we know `event_type` is a character, we can filter values
```{r}
count(filter(df_event, event_type == "public hs", event_state =="CA"))
#below code would return an error because variables are character
#count(filter(df_event, event_type == public hs, event_state ==CA))
```

### Filtering and missing values

Wickham (2018) states:

- "`filter()` only includes rows where condition is TRUE; it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values. To preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:"

\medskip Investigate var `df_event$fr_lunch`, number of free/reduced lunch students

- only available for visits to public high schools

```{r}
#visits to public HS with less than 50 students on free/reduced lunch
count(filter(df_event,event_type == "public hs", fr_lunch<50))
#visits to public HS, where free/reduced lunch missing
count(filter(df_event,event_type == "public hs", is.na(fr_lunch)))
#visits to public HS, where free/reduced is less than 50 OR is missing
count(filter(df_event,event_type == "public hs", fr_lunch<50 | is.na(fr_lunch)))
```

### Exercise

Task

- Create a filter to identify all the high schools that recieved 1 visit from UC Berkeley (110635) AND 1 visit from CU Boulder (126614)[output omitted]

### Solution

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1, visits_by_126614==1)

nrow(filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1, visits_by_126614==1))
count(filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1, visits_by_126614==1))
```


- Must __assign__ to create new object based on filter
```{r results="hide"}
berk_boulder <- filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1, visits_by_126614==1)
count(berk_boulder)
```

```{r}
count(filter(df_event, univ_id == 215293))
```

2. Count the number of recruiting events by Pitt at public or private high schools 
```{r }
str(df_event$event_type)
table(df_event$event_type, useNA = "always")
count(filter(df_event, univ_id == 215293, event_type == "private hs" |
               event_type == "public hs"))
```

### Solution
3. Count the number of recruiting events by Pitt at public or private high schools located in the state of PA
```{r}
count(filter(df_event, univ_id == 215293, event_type == "private hs" |
               event_type == "public hs", event_state == "PA"))
```

4. Count the number of recruiting events by Pitt at public high schools not located in PA where median income is less than 100,000
```{r}
count(filter(df_event, univ_id == 215293, event_type == "public hs",
             event_state != "PA", med_inc < 100000))
```

             event_state != "PA", med_inc >= 100000))
```

6. Count the number of out-of-state recruiting events by Pitt at private high schools or public high schools with median income of at least 100,000
```{r}
count(filter(df_event, univ_id == 215293, event_state != "PA", 
             (event_type == "public hs" & med_inc >= 100000) |
               event_type == "private hs"))
```

## Arrange rows

### `arrange()` function

`arrange()` function "arranges" rows in a data frame; said different, it sorts observations

\medskip
Syntax: `arrange(x,...)`

- First argument, `x`, is a data frame
- Subsequent arguments are a "comma separated list of unquoted variable names"

```{r, results="hide"}
arrange(df_event, event_date)
```
Data frame goes back to previous order unless you __assign__ the new order
```{r, results="hide"}
df_event
df_event <- arrange(df_event, event_date)
df_event
```
### `arrange()` function

Ascending and descending order

- `arrange()` sorts in __ascending__ order by default
- use `desc()` to sort a column by descending order
```{r results="hide"}
arrange(df_event, desc(event_date))
```

Can sort by multiple variables
```{r results="hide"}
arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(event_date), desc(med_inc))

#sort by university and descending by size of 12th grade class; combine with select
select(arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(g12)),instnm,event_type,event_date,g12)
```

### `arrange()`, missing values sorted at the end

Missing values automatically sorted at the end, regardless of whether you sort ascending or descending

Below, we sort by university, then by date of event, then by ID of high school
```{r, results="hide"}
#by university, date, ascending school id
select(arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(event_date), school_id),
       instnm,event_date,event_type,school_id)

#by university, date, descending school id
select(arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(event_date), desc(school_id)),
       instnm,event_date,event_type,school_id)
```
Can sort by `is.na` to put missing values first
```{r}
select(arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(event_date), desc(is.na(school_id))),
       instnm,event_date,event_type,school_id)
```

### Exercise, arranging  

Use the data from df_event, which has one observation for each off-campus recruiting event a university attends

1. Sort ascending by "univ_id" and descending by "event_date"  
1. Select four variables in total and sort ascending by "univ_id" and descending by "event_date"  
1. Now using the same variables from above, sort by `is.na` to put missing values in "school_id" first  

### Solution 
1. Sort ascending by "univ_id" and descending by "event_date"  
```{r}
arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(event_date))
```

### Solution
2. Select four variables in total and sort ascending by "univ_id" and descending by "event_date"  
```{r}
select(arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(event_date)), univ_id, event_date, 
       instnm, event_type)
```

### Solution
3. Select the variables "univ_id", "event_date", and "school_id" and sort  by `is.na` to put missing values in "school_id" first. 
```{r}
select(arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(event_date), desc(is.na(school_id))), 
       univ_id, event_date, school_id)
```


# Investigating data patterns using Base R

### Tidyverse  vs. base R  functions

tidyverse | base R | operation
-------|-------|-------
`select()` |  `[ ]`+ `c()` __OR__ `subset()` | "extract" variables
`filter()` | `[ ]`+ `$` __OR__ `subset()` | "extract" observations
`arrange()` | `order()` | sorting data



## Subsetting using subsetting operators 

### Subsetting to Extract Elements 

Subsetting is the R word for accessing object elements. 

\medskip
Subsetting features can be used to select/exclude elements (i.e., variables and observations)

- there are three subsetting operators: `[]`, `$` , `[[]]` 
- these operators function differently based on vector types (e.g, atomic vectors, lists, data frames)

### Subsetting Atomic Vectors via operators

Six ways to subset an atomic vector using `[]`
\medskip

1. Using positive integers to return elements at specified positions

```{r}
x <- c(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5)
x[c(3, 1)]
```

2. Using negative integers to exclude elements at specified positions
```{r}
x[-c(3,1)] 
```

3. Using logicals to return elements where corresponding logical is `TRUE`
```{r}
x[x>3] #3
```

### Subsetting Atomic Vectors via operators

Six ways to subset an atomic vector using `[]` continued...
\medskip

4. Empty `[]` returns original vector (useful for dataframes)
```{r}
x[] #4
```
5. Zero vector (useful for testing data)
```{r}
x[0]
```
6. Returning character elements with matching names
```{r}
y<- setNames(x, letters[1:5]) #6
y[c("a", "b", "d" )] #6
```


### Subsetting Lists and Matrices via operators

Subsetting lists (arrays and matrices too) via `[]` operator works the same as subsetting an atomic vector

- `[]` simplifies output to the lowest possible dimensionality (i.e.,if you subset a (2D) matrix it will return a 1D vector with however many elements you subset)

```{r}
x <- list(1,2,"apple")
y <- x[c(3, 1)]
typeof(y)

a <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
a #this is a 3X3 matrix

b <- a[c(1,5 )]
b #returns an integer vector with two elements
```


### Subsetting Single Elements from Vectors, Lists, and Matrices via operators
Two other subsetting operators are used for extracting single elements, since subsetting lists with `[]` returns a smaller list

- `[[]]`, `$` 
-  `$` is shorthand operator equivalent to `x[["y"]]` and is used to access variables in a dataframe (will show this in upcoming slides)

\medskip
Example from Hadley: If x is a train carrying objects, then `x[[5]]` is the object in car 5 and `x[4:6]` is a smaller train made up of cars 4, 5, & 6.

```{r}
x <- list(1:3, "a", 4:6)

y <- x[1] #this returns a list
typeof(y)

z <- x[[1]] #this is not a list
typeof(z)
```


### Subsetting Data Frames to extract columns (variables) based on positionality

Selecting columns from a data frame by subsetting with `[]` and a single index based on column positionality 
```{r}
df_event[1:4]
```

### Subsetting Data Frames to extract columns (variables) and rows (observations) based on positionality

Selecting rows and columns from a data frame by subsetting with `[]` and a double index based on row/column positionality 
```{r}
#this returns the first 5 rows and first 3 columns
df_event[1:5, 1:3]
```

```{r results="hide"}
#this returns the first 5 rows and all columns [output omitted]
df_event[1:5, ]
```

### Subsetting Data Frames to extract columns (variables) based on names

Selecting columns from a data frame by subsetting with `[]` and list of column names 
```{r}
df_event[c("instnm", "univ_id", "event_state")] 
```

### Subsetting Data Frames with [] and $ 

- Show all obs where the high school received 1 visit from UC Berkeley (110635) and all columns [output omitted]
```{r results="hide"}
x <- df_school[df_school$visits_by_110635 == 1, ]
```

- Show all obs where the high school received 1 visit from UC Berkeley (110635) and the first three columns [output omitted]
```{r results="hide"}
df_school[df_school$visits_by_110635 == 1, 1:3]
```

- Show all obs where high schools received 1 visit by Bama (100751) and Berkeley (110635)
```{r results="hide"}
df_school[df_school$visits_by_110635 == 1 & df_school$visits_by_100751 == 1, ]
```

### Subsetting Data Frames with [] and $ 

- Show all public high schools with at least 50% Latinx (hispanic in data) student enrollment 

```{r}
#public high schools with at least 50% Latinx student enrollment 
df_CA<- df_school[df_school$school_type == "public" 
                  & df_school$pct_hispanic >= 50 
                  & df_school$state_code == "CA", ]

head(df_CA, n=3)
nrow(df_CA)
```


### Subsetting Data Frames with [] and $, NA Observations

- When extracting observations via subsetting operators, resulting dataframe will include rows where condition is `TRUE`; __as well as__ `NA` values. 

- To remove missing values, ask for values that only evaluate to `TRUE` explicitly via  `which()`

- Task: Show all public high schools with at least $50k median household incomes 

__tidyverse__
```{r, results="hide"}
df_tv <- filter(df_event, event_type == "public hs" & med_inc>=50000)
nrow(df_tv) #9,941 obs

```

__base R without `which()`__
```{r, results="hide"}
df_b1 <- df_event[df_event$event_type == "public hs" & df_event$med_inc>=50000, ]
nrow(df_b1) #10,016 obs
view(df_b1) #NAs sorted at the end of column
```


__base R with `which()`__
```{r, results="hide"}
df_b2 <- df_event[which(df_event$event_type == "public hs" & df_event$med_inc>=50000), ]
nrow(df_b2) #9,941 obs, same as tidyverse way
```


## Subsetting using the subset function

### Subset function

The `subset()` is a base R function and easiest way to "filter" observations 

- can be combined with `select()` base R function to select variables
- can be combined with `count()` for quick comparisons or assignment to create new objects

```{r}
?subset
```

\medskip

Syntax: __subset(x, subset, select, drop = FALSE)__

- x is object to be subsetted
- subset is the logical expression(s) indicating elements (rows) to keep
- select indicates columns to select from data frame (if argument is not used default will keep all columns)
- drop takes `TRUE` or `FALSE` if you want to preserve the original dimensions (only need to worry about dataframes when your subset output is a single column)


### Subset function, examples 

- Show all public high schools that are at least 50% Latinx (hispanic in data) student enrollment in California compared to number of schools that received visit by UC Berkeley

```{r}
#public high schools with at least 50% Latinx student enrollment 
count(subset(df_school, school_type == "public" & pct_hispanic >= 50 
             & state_code == "CA"))

count(subset(df_school, school_type == "public" & pct_hispanic >= 50 
             & state_code == "CA" & visits_by_110635 >= 1))

```


Can also use the %in% operator...
-Show visits by Bama in multiple states
```{r}
count(subset(df_school, visits_by_100751 >= 1 & state_code %in% c("MA","ME","VT")))
```


### Subset function, examples 

- Create new df with all public high schools that are at least 50% Latinx student enrollment in California __AND__ only keep variables `name` and `address` 

```{r}
#public high schools with at least 50% Latinx student enrollment 
df_CA2 <- subset(df_school, school_type == "public" & pct_hispanic >= 50 
             & state_code == "CA", select = c(name, address))
head(df_CA2)
nrow(df_CA2)
```


## Sorting data 

### Base R `sort()` for vectors 


`sort()` is a base R function that sorts vectors
- Syntax: `sort(x, decreasing=FALSE, ...)`; where x is object being sorted
- By default it sorts in ascending order (low to high)
- Need to set decreasing argument to `TRUE` to sort from high to low

```{r}
?sort()
x<- c(31, 5, 8, 2, 25)
sort(x)
sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)
```


### Base R `order()` for dataframes

`order()` is a base R function that sorts vectors

- Syntax: `order(..., na.last = TRUE, decreasing = FALSE)`
- where `...` are variable(s) to sort by
- By default it sorts in ascending order (low to high)
- Need to set decreasing argument to `TRUE` to sort from high to low


Descending argument only works when we want either one (and only) variable descending or all variables descending (when sorting by multiple vars)

- use `-` when you want to indicate which variables are descending while using the default ascending sorting
```{r results="hide"}
df_event[order(df_event$event_date), ] 
df_event[order(df_event$event_date, df_event$total_12), ]

#sort descending via argument
df_event[order(df_event$event_date, decreasing = TRUE), ] 
df_event[order(df_event$event_date, df_event$total_12, decreasing = TRUE), ] 

#sorting by both ascending and descending variables
df_event[order(df_event$event_date, -df_event$total_12), ]
```


# Tidyverse vs base R examples [resource for you]

### Extracting columns (variables)

-Create a new dataframe by extracting the columns `instnm`, `event_date`, `event_type` from df_event. Use the `names()` function to show what columns/variables are in the newly created dataframe.

__tidyverse__
```{r}
df_event_tv <- select(df_event, instnm, event_date, event_type)
names(df_event_tv)
```

__base R__ using subsetting operators
```{r}
df_event_br1 <- df_event[, c("instnm", "event_date", "event_type")]
names(df_event_br1)
```

__base R__ using `subset()` function
```{r}
df_event_br2 <- subset(df_event, select=c(instnm, event_date, event_type))
names(df_event_br2)
```


### Extracting observations 

-Create a new dataframe from df_schools that includes out-of-state public high schools with 50%+ Latinx student enrollment that received at least one visit by the University of California Berkeley.

__tidyverse__
```{r}
df_school_tv <- filter(df_school, state_code != "CA" & school_type == "public" & pct_hispanic >= 50 & visits_by_110635 >=1 )
nrow(df_school_tv)
```

__base R__ using subsetting operators
```{r}
df_school_br1 <- df_school[which(df_school$state_code != "CA" & df_school$school_type == "public" 
                  & df_school$pct_hispanic >= 50 
                  & df_school$visits_by_110635 >=1), ]
nrow(df_school_br1)
```

__base R__ using `subset()` function
```{r}
df_school_br2 <- subset(df_school, state_code != "CA" & school_type == "public" & pct_hispanic >= 50 & visits_by_110635 >=1 )
nrow(df_school_br2)
```



### Sorting observations 

-Create a new dataframe from df_events that sorts by ascending by `event_date`, ascending `event_state`, and descending `pop_total` .

__tidyverse__
```{r results="hide"}
df_event_tv <- arrange(df_event, event_date, event_state, desc(pop_total))
```

__base R__ using  `order()` function
```{r results="hide"}
df_event_br1 <- df_event[order(df_event$event_date, df_event$event_state, 
                               -df_event$pop_total), ]
```
