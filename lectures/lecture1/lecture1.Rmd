# What is R

 
### What is R

### Why R? Capabilities of R

### Base R vs. R packages

INCLUDE INSTALLING AND LOADING PACKAGES

### Functions; function syntax

[I MAY MOVE THIS SLIDE BELOW; JUST WANT YOU TO DRAFT IT]

describe basic syntax of functions in R; how to get help on a function

### RStudio

### RMarkdown

# R basics

### R as a calculator

```{r}
5
5+2
10*3
```

### Executing commands in R

```{r}
5
5+2
10*3
```

Three ways to execute commands in R

1. Type/copy commands directly into the "console"
1. `code chunks' in RMarkdown (.Rmd files)
    - Can execute one command at a time, one chunk at a time, or "knit" the entire document
1. R scripts (.R files)
    - This is just a text file full of R commands
    - Can execute one command at a time, several commands at a time, or the entire script

### Shortcuts you should learn for executing commands

```{r}
5+2
10*3
```

Three ways to execute commands in R

1. Type/copy commands directly into the "console"
1. `code chunks' in RMarkdown (.Rmd files)
    - __Cmd/Ctrl + Enter__: execute highlighted line(s) within chunk
    - __Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + k__: "knit" entire document
1. R scripts (.R files)
    - __Cmd/Ctrl + Enter__: execute highlighted line(s)
    - __Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter__ (without highlighting any lines): run entire script


### Assignment

__Assignment__ means creating a variable -- or more generally, an "object" -- and assigning values to it

- `<-` is the assignment operator
    - in other languages `=` is the assignment operator
- good practice to put a space before and after assignment operator

```{r}
# Create an object and assign value
a <- 5
a

b <- "yay!"
b
```

# Classification of objects

### Objects

Most statistical software (e.g., SPSS, Stata) operates on datasets, which consist of rows of observations and columns of variables

- Usually, these packages can open only one dataset at a time

R is an "object-oriented" programming language (like Python, JavaScript). So, what is an "object"?

- formal computer science definitions are confusing because they require knowledge of concepts we haven't introduced yet
- More intuitively, I think objects as anything I assign values to
    - For example, below, "`a`" and "`b`" are objects I assigned values to
```{r}
a <- 5
a
b <- "yay!"
b
```
    

- Ben Skinner (my R guru) says "Objects are like boxes in which we can put things: data, functions, and even other objects."

### Objects

- Objects can be categorized by "__type__" (which we will discuss today) and by "__class__" (which we will discuss in later weeks)
    - e.g., a date is an object with a numeric _type_ and a date _class_
    - a dataset is an object with a particular type and class
- There is no limit to the number of objects R can hold (except memory)
- R "functions" do different things to different types/classes of objects
    e.g., date functions are meant to process objects with type=numeric and class=date; these functions don't work on objects with type=character (e.g., "yay!")


### Vectors

The fundamental object in R is the "vector"

- A vector is a collection of values
- The individual values within a vector are called "elements"
- Values in a vector can be numeric, character (e.g., "Apple"), or some other _type_

Below we use the combine function `c()` to create a numeric vector that contains three elements

- Help file says that `c()` "combines values into a vector or list"
```{r}
#?c()
x <- c(4, 7, 9)
x
```

Vector where the elements are characters
```{r}
animals <- c("lions", "tigers", "bears", "oh my")
animals
```
### Student task (do with the person next to you)

Either in the R console or within the R markdown file, do the following:

1. Create a vector called `v1` with three elements, where all the elements are numbers. Then print the values.
1. Create a vector called `v2` with four elements, where all the elements are characters (i.e., enclosed in single '' or double "" quotes). Then print the values.
1. Create a vector called `v3` with five elements, where some elements are numeric and some elements are characters. Then print the values.

### Formal classification of vectors in R

Here, I introduce the classification of vectors by Grolemund and Wickham 

There are two broad types of vectors

1. __Atomic vectors__. An object that contains elements. There are six types of atomic vectors: 
    - __logical__, __integer__, __double__, __character__, __complex__, and __raw__. 
        - __Integer__ and __double__ vectors are collectively known as __numeric__ vectors.

2. __Lists__. Like atomic vectors, lists are objects that contain elements
    - elements within a list may be atomic vectors
    - elements within a list may also be other lists; that is lists can contain other lists
    - This sounds vague and confusing; I'll explain and give examples below
    
One difference between atomic vectors and lists: __homogeneous__ vs. __heterogeneous__ elements

* atomic vectors are __homogeneous__: all elements within atomic vector must be of the same type
* lists can be __heterogeneous__: e.g., one element can be an integer and another element can be character

### Formal classification of vectors in R

Here is a visual representation of the Grolemund and Wickham classification

### Developing an intuitive understanding of vector types

__Grolemund and Wickham classification__:

1. __Atomic vectors__. six types: logical, integer, double, character, complex, raw. 
2. __Lists__

Problem with this classification:

- Not conceptually intutive
- Technically, lists are a type of vector, but people often think of atomic vectors and lists as fundamentally different things

__Classification used by my R Guru Ben Skinner__:

- data __type__: logical, numeric (integer and double), character, etc.
- data __structure__: vector, list, matrix, etc.

I find Skinner's classification more intuitive conceptually. However, it isn't consistent with R functions or the way R thinks about objects. 

If you find this classification of data _type_ and data _structure_ helpful, totally fine to think of objects in this way while you start to learn R.

# Atomic vectors

### "Length" of an atomic vector is the number of elements

\medskip For remainder of lecture, I'll use the term __vector__ to refer to atomic vectors

Use `length()` function to examine vector length
```{r}
x <- c(4, 7, 9)
x
length(x)

animals <- c("lions", "tigers", "bears", "oh my")
animals
length(animals)
```

A single number (or a single string/character) is a vector with `length==1`
```{r}
z <- 5
length(z)
length("Tommy")
```


### Data type of a vector

\medskip The "type" of an atomic vector refers to the elements within the vector. 

While there are six "types" of actomic vectors, we'll focus on the following types:

- numeric: 
    - "integer" (e.g., 5)
    - "double" (e.g., 5.5)
- character (e.g., "ozan")
- logical (e.g., `TRUE`, `FALSE`)

Use `typeof()` function to examine vector type
```{r}
x
typeof(x)

p <- c(1.5, 1.6)
p
typeof(p)

animals
typeof(animals)
```

### Data type of a vector, numeric

Numeric vectors can be "integer" (e.g., 5) or "double" (e.g., 5.5)


```{r}
typeof(1.5)
```

R stores numbers as doubles by default.
```{r}
x
typeof(x)

```

To make an integer, place an `L` after the number:
```{r}
typeof(5)
typeof(5L)
```

### Data type of a vector, character

In contrast to "numeric" data types wich are used to store numbers, the "character" data type is used to store __strings__ of text.  

- Strings may contain any combination of numbers, letters, symbols, etc.
- Character vectors are sometimes referred to as string vectors

When creating a vector where elements have `type==character` (or when referring to the value of a string), place single `` or double "" quotes around text

- the text within quotes is the "string"

```{r}
c1 <- c("cat",'cash','candy cane')
c1
typeof(c1)
length(c1)
```
Numeric values can also be stored as strings
```{r}
c2 <- c("1","2","3")
c2
typeof(c2)
```


### Data type of a vector, logical

Logical vectors can take three possible values: `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NA`

- `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NA` are special keywords; they are different from the character strings `"TRUE"`, `"FALSE"`, `"NA"`
- Don't worry about `"NA"` for now

```{r}
typeof(TRUE)
typeof("TRUE")

typeof(c(TRUE,FALSE,NA))
typeof(c(TRUE,FALSE,NA,"FALSE"))

log <- c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,NA,FALSE)
typeof(log)
length(log)
```
We'll learn more about logical vectors later

### All elements in (atomic) vector must have same data type.

Atomic vectors are __homogenous__;

- An atomic vector has one data type
- all elements within an atomic vector must have the same data "type"

If a vector contains elements of different type, the vector type will be type of the most "complex" element

Atomic vector types from simplest to most complex: 

- logical < integer < double < character

```{r}
typeof(c(TRUE,TRUE,NA))
typeof(c(TRUE,TRUE,NA,1L)) # recall L after an integer forces type to be integer rather than double
typeof(c(TRUE,TRUE,NA,1.5))
typeof(c(TRUE,TRUE,NA,1.5,"howdy!"))
```

### Named vectors

All vectors can be "named" (i.e., name individual elements within vector)

Example of creating an unamed vector

- the `str()` function "compactly display[s] the internal structure of an R object" [from help file]; very useful for describing objects
```{r}
#?str
x <- c(1,2,3,"hi!")
x
str(x)
```

Example of creating a named vector
```{r}
y <- c(a=1,b=2,3,c="hi!")
y
str(y)
```
### Sequences

(Loose) definition: a sequence is a set of numbers in ascending or descending order

A vector containing a "sequence" of numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3) can be created using the colon operator `:` with the notation `start:end`
```{r}
-5:5
5:-5
s<- 1:10 #same as this: s<- c(1:10)
s
length(s)
```
Creating sequences using `seq()` function

- basic syntax [with default values]: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
seq(from = 1, to = 1, by = 1)
```

```{r}
seq(10,15)
seq(from=10,to=15,by=1)
seq(from=100,to=150,by=10)
```

### Vectorized math

Most mathematical operations operate on each element of the vector

- e.g., add a single value to a vector and that value added to each element of the vector
```{r}
1:3
1:3+.5
(1:3)*2
```
Mathematical operations involving two vectors with the same length behave differently

- e.g., for addition: add element 1 of vector 1 to element 1 of vector 2, add element 2 of vector 1 to element 2 of vector 2, etc.
```{r}
c(1,1,1)+c(1,0,2)
c(1,1,1)*c(1,0,2)
```

# Lists

### Lists

What is a __list__?

- Like (atomic) vectors, a list is an object that contains __elements__
- Unlike vectors, data types can differ across elements within a list
- An element within a list can be another list
    - this characteristic makes lists more complicated than vectors
    - suitable for representing hierarchical data

Lists are more complicated than vectors; today we'll just provide a basic introduction

### Create lists using `list()` function

Create a vector (for comparison purposes)
```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3)
typeof(a)
length(a)
```
Create a list
```{r}
b <- list(1,2,3)
typeof(b)
length(b)
b # print list is awkward
```


### Investigate structure of lists using `str()` function

When investigating lists, `str()` is better than printing the list

```{r}
b <- list(1,2,3)
typeof(b)
length(b)
str(b) # 3 elements, each element is a numeric vector w/ length=1
```

```{r}
c <- list(c(3,4),c(-5,1,3))
typeof(c)
length(c)
str(c) # 2 elements; element 1=vector w/ length=2; element 2=vector w/length=3
```

### Elements within list can have different data types

Lists are __heterogeneous__

- data types can differ across elements within a list
```{r}
b <- list(1,2,"apple")
typeof(b)
length(b)
str(b)
```
Vector are __homogeneous__
```{r}
a <- c(1,2,"apple")
typeof(a)
str(a)
```

### Lists can contain other lists

```{r}
x1 <- list(c(1,2), list("apple", "orange"), list(1, 2, 3))
typeof(x1)
length(x1)
str(x1)
```

Note that:

- first element of list is a numeric vector with length=2
- second element is a list with length=2
    - first element is character vector with length=1
    - second element is character vector with length=1
- third element is with length=3
    - first element is numeric vector with length=1
    - second element is numeric vector with length=1
    - third element is numeric vector with length=1
    
### You can name each element in the list

```{r}
x2 <- list(a=c(1,2), b=list("apple", "orange"), c=list(1, 2, 3))
str(x2)
```

`names()` function shows names of elements in the list
```{r}
names(x2) # has names
names(x1) # no names
```

### Access individual elements in a "named" list

Syntax: `list_name$element_name`
```{r}
x2 <- list(a=1, b=list("apple", "orange"), c=list(1, 2, 3))
typeof(x2$a)
length(x2$a)

typeof(x2$b)
length(x2$b)

typeof(x2$c)
length(x2$c)
```
Note: We'll spend more time practicing "accessing elements of a list" in upcoming weeks

### Compare structure of list to structure of element within a list

```{r}
str(x2)

str(x2$c)
```


### A dataset is just a list!

\medskip A data frame is a list with the following characteristics:

- Data type can differ across elements (like all lists)
- Each __element__ in data frame must be a __vector__, not a __list__
    - Each element (column) is a variable
- Each element in a data frame must have the same length
    - The length of an element is the number of observations (rows)
    - so each variable in data frame must have same number of observations
- Each element is named
    - these element names are the variable names

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- select(mtcars,mpg,cyl,hp) # ignore for now
```

```{r}
names(df)
head(df, n=5) # print first 5 rows
```

Additionally, data frames have "attributes"; we'll discuss those in upcoming weeks

### A data frame is a named list

```{r}
typeof(df)
names(df)
length(df) # length=number of variables
str(df)
```
Like any named list, can examine the elements

- Individual elements of a data frame are the variables
- these variables are vectors with length equal to the number of rows/observations
```{r}
typeof(df$mpg)
length(df$mpg) # length=number of rows/obs
str(df$mpg)
```



### Main takeaways about atomic vectors and lists

Basic data stuctures

1. __(Atomic) vectors__: __logical__, __integer__, __double__, __character__. 
    - each element in vector must have same data type
2. __Lists__: 
    - Data type can differ across elements

Takeaways

- These concepts are difficult; ok to feel confused
- I will reinforce these concepts throughout the course
- Good practice: run simple diagnostics on any new object
    - `length()` : how many __elements__ in the object
    - `typeof()` : what __type__ of data is the object
    - `str()` : hierarchical structure of the object

### Main takeaways about atomic vectors and lists

Basic data stuctures

1. __(Atomic) vectors__: __logical__, __integer__, __double__, __character__. 
    - each element in vector must have same data type
2. __Lists__: 
    - Data type can differ across elements

Takeaways

- These data structures (vectors, lists) and data types (e.g., character, numeric, logical) are the basic building blocks of all object oriented programming languages
- Application to statistical analysis
    - Datasets are just lists
    - The individual elements -- columns/variables -- within a dataset are just vectors
- These structures and data types are foundational for all "data science" applications
    - e.g., mapping, webscraping, network analysis, etc.
